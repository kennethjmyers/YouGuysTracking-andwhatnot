# Expedia Hotel Recommendation

My submissions exploit the [data leak](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/forums/t/20345/data-leak) and my scripts will primarily be based off of [ZFTurbo's](https://www.kaggle.com/zfturbo/expedia-hotel-recommendations/leakage-solution/comments) (which exploits the leak but uses minimal modeling).
